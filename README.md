# Lua Script Error: Missing 'end' Keyword

This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua scripting: forgetting the `end` keyword after conditional statements or loops.  The error arises when an `if` statement (or a `for` loop, etc.) is not properly closed, resulting in a syntax error.

The `bug.lua` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.lua` file provides the corrected version.
